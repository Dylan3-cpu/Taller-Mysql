## üß† Final Query for Point 4

The following query is executed to get a summary per supplier:

```sql
SELECT 
    prov.id as supplier_id,
    prov.name as supplier_name,
    prov.contact,
    COUNT(DISTINCT prod.id) as products_offered,
    COUNT(dp.id) as total_sales,
    SUM(dp.quantity) as units_sold,
    SUM(dp.quantity * dp.price) as total_revenue
FROM Suppliers prov
INNER JOIN Products prod ON prov.id = prod.supplier_id
LEFT JOIN OrderDetails dp ON prod.id = dp.product_id
GROUP BY prov.id, prov.name, prov.contact
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
